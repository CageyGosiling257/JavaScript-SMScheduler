To run the website, visit: https://cageygosiling257.pythonanywhere.com/

If the above URL does not work then follow these directions:
    1. Run the app.py file.
    2. In the console there will be a link to run the app on your local host. Ctrl-Click that.
    3. Use the website as normal.

NOTE: Given the fact that I am using a free hosting service, it may take a few minutes for
      you to receive the text message reminders that you created.  I tested it and it took
      about 6 minutes to receive my text message due to the quota my hosting service puts
      on my website.
